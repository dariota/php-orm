## php-orm

A very simplistic ORM, built on PHP5.6 and thoroughly untested, other than by
checking that a basic test file runs without warnings or errors.

### Why?

I felt like giving writing an ORM another shot after my terrific (unpublished)
failure two years ago.

### That's not the why I meant

**Why not use an existing one?** I kinda felt like writing my own, and intend to
run this on a shared server I don't want to install that sort of dependencies
on.

**Why PHP5.6?** That's the version on the server.

**Why not just use something that's not PHP like other people on that server?**
I've already got a very fragile config/setup built on top of the existing hacky
setup. This seemed like more fun than fixing my config and the underlying one.

**Why don't you implement $feature?** YAGNI.

### What other project is this supporting?

I'll add a link here when I've done it, but TL;DR: a recipe site with search on
various things I care about (prep/cook time, allergen information, ingredients
etc.).
